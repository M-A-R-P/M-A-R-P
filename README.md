<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, Nice to see you!<br>Welcome to My GitHub Profile</h1>
<h1 align="center">I'm Md. Abu Rayhan Prince</h1>
<h3 align="left">I am a passionate and adaptable IT professional with a strong academic foundation in Computer Science and practical experience as an Assistant IT Engineer and Data Analyst. My professional journey merges key disciplinesâ€”Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligenceâ€”with a growing interest in Data Science. I thrive at the intersection of development, testing, and digital security, where I aim to design intelligent, secure, and efficient systems that tackle real-world challenges.</h3>
<h2 align="left">ðŸ’¡Career Goals:</h2>
<h3 align="left">My career objective is to become a leading expert in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with a specialized focus on transforming healthcare through the responsible and secure deployment of intelligent systems. I aspire to harness advanced AI techniquesâ€”such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative AI, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Learning (DL)â€”to drive innovations in medical diagnostics, real-time patient monitoring, and personalized treatment strategies. In parallel with clinical advancements, I am strongly committed to the security and ethical deployment of AI, particularly in safeguarding Large Language Models (LLMs). My goal is to explore adversarial threats, strengthen model robustness, and implement privacy-preserving techniques to ensure the secure integration of AI technologies in safety-critical domains like healthcare. Moreover, I place a strong emphasis on Explainable AI (XAI), aiming to design interpretable, transparent, and accountable AI systems. By promoting fairness and trust, I seek to bridge the gap between AI and its end usersâ€”clinicians, patients, and stakeholdersâ€”ensuring responsible AI adoption in healthcare and cybersecurity contexts.</h3>
<h2 align="left">ðŸ“šCurrent Focus:</h2>
<h3 align="left"> - Federated Learning, Responsible AI & Ethical Guidelines, Secure Deployment of AI/LLMs, Reinforcement Learning in Healthcare</h3>
<h3 align="left"> - Preparing for industry certifications to strengthen my technical foundation.</h3>
